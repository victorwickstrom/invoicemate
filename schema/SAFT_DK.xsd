    Minimal SAF‑T DK XSD schema used to validate exported files.

    The Danish bookkeeping act references the OECD SAF‑T specification but
    does not yet provide a public XSD file.  To ensure that the XML
    documents generated by Invoicemate have at least a well‑formed
    structure, this schema defines the root AuditFile element and
    permits any child elements within it.  Additional validation rules
    may be added here once the official schema becomes available.
